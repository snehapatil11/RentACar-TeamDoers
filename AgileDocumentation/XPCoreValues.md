# XP Core Values

## Communication:
This core value was held by Sneha. Held responsible for communicating about the task she has planned and task she has completed. This core value made sure that the entire team has clear comminucation about what stories they are working on and what tasks they have completed. We had a weekly scrum call for weekly updates and next week plan. This value helped us completing the project as a team by prioritizing it.
