# XP Core Values

## Communication:
This core value was held by Sneha. Held responsible for communicating about the task she has planned and task she has completed. This core value made sure that the entire team has clear comminucation about what stories they are working on and what tasks they have completed. We had a weekly scrum call for weekly updates and next week plan. This value helped us completing the project as a team by prioritizing it.

## Feedback:
This core value was held by Ambika. Held responsible for ensuring multiple feedback loops. We provided feedback on design which helped us in avoiding re-works on same functionality. Through constant feedbacks, it was easier to finalise design of required functionalities and also made implementation straight-forward. 

## Courage:
This core value was held by Manasa. Held responsible for taking courage to tell truth honestly at every stage. Not every task effort can be estimated upfront. When choice of technology was a dilemma in the team while in system design phase, Manasa took a decision in the benefit of the team to learn an entire new tech stack in a very limited time. Updated the team whenever there was a challenge while developing the code or configuring it. Expressed courage in being honest and frank at each and every stage of coding, even when encountered unknown/unexpected challenges.  Took feedback from team members frequently and implemented them, while observing team skill.
