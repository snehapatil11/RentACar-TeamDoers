# Adjustment made by Professor's suggestion
Skip Admin entering and updating individual vehicles and rental locations - instead insert sample data in the database and add or update using queries directly.

[Admin queries here !](https://github.com/gopinathsjsu/sp20-cmpe-202-sec-03-team-project-202-doers/tree/master/Code/DBQueries)
